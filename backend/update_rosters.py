# Overall Flow

# loop through the teams

# scrape the roster from NFL & query your DB roster
# initialize an empty removed_players, added_players
# go through the response from the NFL site, finding the names in your DB
# if name is not found, add it to removed_players

# think you have to be going through both lists of players at the same time
# if a player is in your DB roster, but not in the NFL roster, they've been removed from the team
# if a player is not in your DB roster, but is in the NFL roster, they've been added to the team
# one way to do it would be to do a lookup on the player to see if they exist or not


# questions

# should there be overarching removed_players & added_players (& new_players?) dicts that store player's name & team
# use those two to handle matches, retires, new guys
# think for the case of new guys, you want to store all of the player's info in added_players so you don't have to go back to get it if they don't have a previous team?
